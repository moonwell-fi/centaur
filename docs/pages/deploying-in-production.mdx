# Deploying in Production

Production Centaur is a Kubernetes deployment with durable API state in
Postgres, sandbox pods for agent execution, and [iron-proxy](https://docs.iron.sh) for credential
injection. The goal is a small working deployment with a clear operator before
you add more tools, workflows, harnesses, or overlays.

## Production shape

The API saves threads, runs, and events in Postgres. The Kubernetes backend
creates sandbox pods for agent work. [iron-proxy](https://docs.iron.sh) handles outbound requests that
need credentials:

  <figcaption>Slackbot and API ingress → Centaur API (Postgres-backed) → Kubernetes sandbox runtime → outbound traffic through iron-proxy.</figcaption>
</figure>

Each pod receives the prompt files, environment, proxy CA, proxy settings, and
command it needs for one assigned thread. It should not receive raw model keys
or third-party API keys.

## 1. Choose the operating boundary

Before installing, decide:

| Question | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|
| Who is the operator? | Someone must own secrets, upgrades, incidents, and access reviews. |
| What Slack workspace and channels matter? | Defines the first user and permission boundary. |
| What repos should agents work on? | Determines GitHub token scope and repo cache needs. |
| What tools or data sources matter first? | Keeps setup focused on one useful loop. |
| What is sensitive? | Determines private channels, tool scopes, and review requirements. |

Good first deployments have one narrow engineering, research, support, security,
data, or operations workflow where agents can call real tools.

## 2. Create the infra secret

The Helm chart reads infrastructure values from an existing Kubernetes Secret.
By default that Secret is named `centaur-infra-env`:

```yaml
secretManager:
  existingSecretName: centaur-infra-env
  envPrefix: ""
```

For local development, `just bootstrap-secrets` creates this Secret from your
shell environment. In production, create it through your normal secret delivery
path before installing the chart.

Minimum keys:

| Secret | Required for | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | API | Postgres connection string. |
| `IRON_MANAGEMENT_API_KEY` | [iron-proxy](https://docs.iron.sh) management API | Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `SANDBOX_SIGNING_KEY` | Sandbox API tokens | Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`; keeps sandbox tokens valid across API restarts. |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Slackbot | Bot User OAuth Token from the Slack app. |
| `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | Slackbot/API | Used to verify Slack webhook signatures. |
| `SLACKBOT_API_KEY` | Slackbot to API | Static service token; API bootstraps it into Postgres on startup with `agent` scope. |
| `OP_CONNECT_TOKEN` | [iron-proxy](https://docs.iron.sh) 1Password Connect source (preferred) | Needed when `ironProxy.secretSource` is `onepassword-connect`. |
| `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` | [iron-proxy](https://docs.iron.sh) 1Password service-account source | Needed when `ironProxy.secretSource` is `onepassword`. |
| `OP_VAULT` | [iron-proxy](https://docs.iron.sh) 1Password source | Vault name or id used for `op://` references (either mode). |

`SLACKBOT_API_KEY` is not created with the admin API during initial boot, because
the API process requires it before it can start. Generate a high-entropy value,
store it in the infra Secret, and reuse the same value in Slackbot.

## 3. Configure harness credentials

Store one secret per enabled harness credential:

| Harness | API value | Slack selector | Credential to store | Upstream |
|---------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|----------|
| Codex default | `codex` | none or `--codex` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `api.openai.com` |
| Amp | `amp` | `--amp` | `AMP_API_KEY` | `ampcode.com` |
| Claude Code | `claude-code` | `--claude` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `api.anthropic.com` |
| pi-mono | `pi-mono` | `--pi` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `api.anthropic.com` |

In normal sandbox mode, containers receive placeholder values such as
`OPENAI_API_KEY=OPENAI_API_KEY`. [iron-proxy](https://docs.iron.sh) swaps the
placeholder for the real key on outbound requests, only on the hosts and
headers the secret is bound to.

When `ironProxy.secretSource` is `onepassword`, [iron-proxy](https://docs.iron.sh) resolves these values
from `op://$OP_VAULT/<SECRET_NAME>/credential`. For example, store the default
Codex credential in a 1Password item named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Whatever source you pick, the vault is shared across the whole deployment,
so any thread can use any configured credential. Per-user and per-channel
scoping is on the roadmap; until then, scope tool and harness access
accordingly. See [Security](/security) for the full threat model.

### Optional local OAuth/subscription auth

Codex and Claude Code can use local CLI auth state instead of the API-key
path. This is meant for deployments that need Codex subscriptions or Claude
Code subscription/card auth. It is not automatic and is not handled by
[iron-proxy](https://docs.iron.sh): the sandbox reconstructs the provider's
local auth files so the CLI starts as logged in.

For local development, run:

```bash
bun run auth:bootstrap
source .env.local
just bootstrap-secrets
```

If local auth is missing, `auth:bootstrap` prints the exact login command. To
stream the device/browser setup flow from the bootstrap command itself, run:

```bash
bun run auth:bootstrap -- --login
```

For production, deliver these keys through the same infra Secret transport you
use for other chart secrets, but put them in a separate Secret. The chart
defaults to:

```yaml
harnessAuth:
  existingSecretName: centaur-harness-auth
```

| Secret | Used for |
|--------|----------|
| `CODEX_AUTH_JSON` | Codex local auth file reconstruction. |
| `CLAUDE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` | Claude Code Linux credentials file reconstruction. |

Then enable only the providers you intend to use:

```yaml
sandbox:
  extraEnv:
    CODEX_USE_LOCAL_AUTH: "true"
    CLAUDE_USE_LOCAL_AUTH: "true"
```

The Kubernetes sandbox backend mounts auth payloads from Secret references, not
literal PodSpec values, and scopes them by engine: Codex pods receive only
Codex auth, Claude pods receive only Claude auth, and Amp receives none. If a
local auth payload is missing, the entrypoint preserves the normal API-key
fallback path. Do not put these payloads in `centaur-infra-env`; the API pod
imports that Secret with `envFrom`.

Claude Code subscription credentials contain a rotating refresh token, so they
are best treated as a narrow opt-in path rather than fleet auth. Prefer Console
API keys, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, or an auth helper/gateway for concurrent pods.

Durable provider resume is separately opt-in:

```yaml
sandbox:
  extraEnv:
    HARNESS_DURABLE_RESUME: "true"
```

When enabled, Centaur uses provider-specific resume ids:
`AMP_CONTINUE_THREAD_ID`, `CODEX_CONTINUE_THREAD_ID`, and
`CLAUDE_CONTINUE_SESSION_ID`. When disabled, the legacy resume behavior is left
unchanged.

## 4. Configure Slack

Create the Slackbot app at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps).
Use the app page to install the bot, copy the Bot User OAuth Token for
`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, and copy the Signing Secret for `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`.

1. Add the bot scopes required by the Slackbot features you enable.
2. Install the app to the workspace.
3. Store the Bot User OAuth Token as `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`.
4. Store the app Signing Secret as `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`.
5. Enable Event Subscriptions.
6. Set the Request URL to `https://<your-host>/api/webhooks/slack`.
7. Subscribe to `app_mention` and to the message events you want Centaur to see:
   `message.channels`, `message.groups`, and `message.im`.

The Slackbot currently normalizes Slack `app_mention` and `message` events.
Do not rely on assistant-specific Slack event types unless the Slackbot code has
explicit support for them.

Do not put Centaur API-key auth in front of `/api/webhooks/slack`; the Slackbot
validates Slack's signature and then calls the Centaur API separately.

The Slackbot accepts Slack events at `/api/webhooks/slack`. It also registers
compatibility paths for `/api/slack/events`, `/api/slack/actions`,
`/api/slack/options`, and `/api/slack/commands`.

## 5. Deploy with Helm

The chart lives at `contrib/chart`. Select service images, [iron-proxy](https://docs.iron.sh) secret
source, sandbox image, and optional runtime class in your values file:

```yaml
secretManager:
  existingSecretName: centaur-infra-env
  envPrefix: ""

api:
  executionWorkerEnabled: true
  warmPoolEnabled: true

ironProxy:
  secretSource: onepassword-connect
  secretTtl: 10m

onepasswordConnect:
  connect:
    create: true
    credentialsName: centaur-onepassword-connect-credentials
    credentialsKey: 1password-credentials.json

sandbox:
  image:
    repository: centaur-agent
    tag: latest
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  runtimeClassName: gvisor
```

The Kubernetes sandbox backend is the active runtime backend; there is no chart
switch named `api.sandboxBackend`.

Install or upgrade:

```bash
helm lint contrib/chart
helm upgrade --install centaur contrib/chart \
  --namespace centaur-system \
  --create-namespace \
  -f values.production.yaml
```

## 6. Verify the deployment

Check health from inside the API deployment first. Localhost is accepted for
operator-only routes, so this avoids needing an external admin key for the first
smoke check:

```bash
kubectl exec -n centaur-system deploy/centaur-centaur-api -- \
  curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/health

kubectl exec -n centaur-system deploy/centaur-centaur-api -- \
  curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/health/ready | jq

kubectl exec -n centaur-system deploy/centaur-centaur-api -- \
  curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/health/tools | jq
```

If you need to call operator routes from outside the cluster, use a configured
admin key such as `LOCAL_DEV_API_KEY` to create a narrower operator key and
save the returned plaintext key:

```bash
ADMIN_KEY=$(kubectl exec -n centaur-system deploy/centaur-centaur-api -- printenv LOCAL_DEV_API_KEY)

kubectl exec -n centaur-system deploy/centaur-centaur-api -- \
  curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:8000/admin/api-keys \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ADMIN_KEY}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"name":"operator","scopes":["admin"],"created_by":"ops"}' | jq
```

External operator calls then use:

```bash
curl -s "$CENTAUR_API_URL/health/tools" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $ADMIN_KEY" | jq
```

Run one agent turn from inside the API deployment:

```bash
THREAD_KEY=production-smoke-codex
API_KEY=$(kubectl exec -n centaur-system deploy/centaur-centaur-api -- printenv SLACKBOT_API_KEY)

SPAWN=$(kubectl exec -n centaur-system deploy/centaur-centaur-api -- curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/spawn \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"thread_key\":\"${THREAD_KEY}\"}")
ASSIGNMENT_GENERATION=$(printf '%s' "$SPAWN" | jq -r '.assignment_generation')

kubectl exec -n centaur-system deploy/centaur-centaur-api -- curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/message \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"thread_key\":\"${THREAD_KEY}\",\"assignment_generation\":${ASSIGNMENT_GENERATION},\"role\":\"user\",\"parts\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"Reply with exactly PONG.\"}]}"

EXECUTE=$(kubectl exec -n centaur-system deploy/centaur-centaur-api -- curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/execute \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"thread_key\":\"${THREAD_KEY}\",\"assignment_generation\":${ASSIGNMENT_GENERATION},\"delivery\":{\"platform\":\"dev\"}}")
EXECUTION_ID=$(printf '%s' "$EXECUTE" | jq -r '.execution_id')

kubectl exec -n centaur-system deploy/centaur-centaur-api -- curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  "http://localhost:8000/agent/executions/${EXECUTION_ID}" | jq
```

Then run the same prompt through Slack:

```text
reply with exactly PONG
```

Slack messages without a harness flag use Codex. Use `--amp`, `--claude`,
`--codex`, or `--pi` only when you want to select a specific harness.

Inspect sandbox pods with the labels Centaur actually sets:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n centaur-system -l centaur.ai/managed=true
```

If a run fails because the sandbox pod exits or is deleted, inspect the durable
execution before retrying:

```bash
kubectl exec -n centaur-system deploy/centaur-centaur-api -- curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  "http://localhost:8000/agent/executions/${EXECUTION_ID}" | jq

kubectl logs -n centaur-system deploy/centaur-centaur-api --tail=200
kubectl get pods -n centaur-system -l centaur.ai/managed=true
```

Centaur preserves the execution row and event trail; retry by starting a new
turn after you understand whether the failure was credentials, image pull,
network policy, harness startup, or the upstream model/tool call.

## 7. Keep the operating loop small

Before expanding the deployment, record:

1. The operator.
2. Where secrets live.
3. How to restart the stack.
4. The first working Slack channel.
5. The enabled harnesses.
6. The first useful tool or workflow.
7. How to inspect logs and failed runs.

The operator's job is to leave behind a repeatable operating loop, not a
one-time demo.
